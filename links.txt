Best Router For DD-WRT
Likes LINKSYS WRT1900ACS, the predecessor of my "iconic WTR54GL.
It sports similar looks, and comes unlocked and ready for open-source
firmware. Flash with a single click."
o Processor: 1.6GHz dual-core Marvell
o Ram Memory: 512MB
o Flash Memory: 128MB
o Wi-Fi: Simultaneous Dual Band 2.4 + 5GHZ. 4 External Antennas.
o Wireless Transfer Speeds: AC1300 + N600 =  1900Mbps
Also likes ASUS AC5300, advises a few extra steps to install DD-WRT though.
